Hi! I'm Felipe Ventura. I am currently an Executive Director at [Techqueria](http://techqueria.org), an organization for Latinx in tech. My background is in community organizing and software engineering. I believe in the transformative change of community networks on an individual and societal level. The focus of my work is building and scaling these networks.

Recently, I think a lot about how information flows across community networks and how its members learn to share their visions of whatâ€™s possible, how they become agents of change, and how they make meaningful commitments to work with others. This space is an ongoing exploration of this labor on a number of fronts. [Feel free to reach out to me](/pages/contacts)!
