## [Draft] Notes on Pedagogy of the Oppressed -  2 of 4 

**The "banking" concept of education as an instrument of oppression**

The dominant teacher-student relationship is one defined by its narrative character where the teacher acts as a Subject and the students as listening objects. The term "banking" describes this form of education because the students are functioning as receptacles being filled with the teacher's knowledge. Education becomes an act of depositing and by storing the deposits the student advances in their learning. Teachers regulate how reality enters their studetnts. The banking model serves the interest of the oppressors by maintaining the existing order because the students are not equipped with a pedagogy to critically and co-intentionally consider reality. 

**The problem-posing concept of education as an instrument for liberation**

In contrast to the banking concept is the problem-posing concept of education that focuses on developing conciousness that is intent upon the world in order to transform it. People teach each other mediated by the world and its cognizable objects. This form of liberatory education focuses on acts of cognition instead of transferrals of information. It involves a constant unveiling of reality.

**The "banking" concept and the teacher-student contradiction**
**The problem-posing concept and the supersedence of the teacher- student contradiction**
**Education: a mutual process, world-mediated** 
**People as uncompleted beings**
