## [Draft] Approaches to Dismantling the Global Surveillance 

The following exploration takes as a point of departure the position that the surveillance and crime prevention software supplied to police departments across this country serve to reinforce systemic racism and oppression. For an in-depth analysis of how algorithms reflect the biases of the people that create them, check out Professor Safiya Noble's book [*Algorithms of Oppression*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_of_Oppression)! 

I want to explore the latter part of [Edward Ongweso Jr's](https://twitter.com/bigblackjacobin) recent article [*Police and Big Tech Are Partners in Crime. We Need to Abolish Them Both*](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8898g3/police-and-big-tech-are-partners-in-crime-we-need-to-abolish-them-both) more in depth here. He proposes the following as ways to shift the balance of the data panoption we live in:
* austerity for surveillance and social control instead of public institutions 
* increasing the public ownership of data in order to solve social problems 
* public conversation about the tech that certain sectors are allowed to use and not use
* democratizing the production of tech to enable a shift from capital accumulation to social good
