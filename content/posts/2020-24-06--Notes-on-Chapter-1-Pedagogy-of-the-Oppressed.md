## [Draft] Notes on Pedagogy of the Oppressed -  1 of 4 

**The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed**

Freire frames oppression as a limiting situation that only the oppressed themselves can transform. Dehumanization requires uncompleted beings conscious of their incompleteness. Humanization is the process of overcoming that alienation. A liberatory pedagogy requires oppressed people to recognize the causes of their dehumanization. 

It also presents a paradox. Oppressed people exist without the freedom to exist authentically while also inhabiting fear of what freedom entails. This is a space free of the oppressor within. The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed is to facilitate concrete action against oppression through critical awareness of oppression. Critical awareness here is the knowledge and understanding of social structutes and the dynamics between them and individuals. It leads the individual from oppressed Object to liberated Subject.

There are two stages of the pedagogy of the oppressed. The first is a commitment to transformation from oppressed Object to liberated Subject. The second stage is the ongoing process of social liberation and creation of a society where permanent liberation becomes an activity of all. Liberation describes the modes of action and reflection that humans employ to transform social order.

So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? Because everyone deserves to be free and engaged in the process of exploring their own humanity. This cannot be done for anyone. It is dialogical process done with others.

**The contradiction between the oppressors and the oppressed, and how it is overcome**

The duality of the oppressed is one shaped by and existing in oppression and violence. When the oppressed person reacts to the violence and dehumananization imposed by their oppressors, the oppressing class interprets this an attack on their person. It dislocates the oppressor from the priveleges afforded by the labor and value extracted from the oppressed class which has otherwise been normalized. Normalizing that reality dehumanizes the oppressor.

Only the oppressed can take away the oppressor's ability to dominate and suppress. This is an act that Freire describes as love but I would descibe more as fierce compassion. Its culmination is the dissolution of the oppressed/oppressor dynamic and leads humans to the process of liberation.
