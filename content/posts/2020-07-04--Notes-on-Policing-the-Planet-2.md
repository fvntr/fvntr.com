## BROKEN WINDOWS AT BLUE’S: A QUEER HISTORY OF GENTRIFICATION AND POLICING

This essay by Professor Hanhardt starts with the Blue's Bar police raid in 1982 that galvinized LGBT activists to fight against a surging  wave of gentrification. The response is linked to the Stonewall Uprising and is presented as a continuation of the Queer community's struggle for safety in the face of state violence. A new dimension to this ongoing effort is presented as well, one that sought to change the public's perception of white, middle class homosexuality as being a valuable asset to the city's real estate development. Together with PR campaigns, there was concentrated investment in traditionally gay neighborhoods. 

The capital flowing into these newly gentrified areas contributed to the expansion of violence against Black and Latinx communities, enshrined in policies like "stop and frisk". This was especially the case in parts of the city with the most speculative investment activity. Professor Hanhardt explains how “the celebration of gay investment alongside attacks like the one at Blue’s demonstrates the often bifurcated function of marginalized identity and social non-normativity in postwar urban development policy.” Celebration in this case largely occurred through the press. Newspapers, as an extension of state power, served the interests of the real estate industry and advocated for the development of neighborhoods that were the most likely to increase their subscription base. The fourth estate's support for a policing theory focused on an individualized origin for 'social disorder' was good for business.  

Aided by the press, attitudes towards white gay homosexuality started shifting. However, other members of the Queer community continued facing discrimination. In the late 70s, mainstream gay activism focused on crime control within communities, ignoring in large part the members of the community that did not benefit from white or class priveledge. Leading up to the raid of Blue's Bar, a number of mainstream gay activists supported community partner policing models. In doing so, they became complicit in the liberal vision that framed the War on Poverty. 

Others, especially those margianilzied within the Queer community, organized to challenge this form of gentrification and the perception of safety, instead of true enactment of safety, it aimed to create. Through their work, they have created a deeper awareness of how the regulation of non-heternonormative behavior is linked intimately with the real estate machine. 


## ENDING BROKEN WINDOWS POLICING IN NEW YORK CITY: AN INTERVIEW WITH JOO-HYUN KANG

This is an interview with Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform (CPR), a campaign to end discriminatory policing practices in New York. 

The key point that stood out was how community problems need to be taken up by the whole community, particularly the parts of the community that are most impacted by the issues. As policing in urban areas has evolved, it increasingly encompaases more social work outside the realm of traditional police work. This explains the disastrous outcomes that we are seeing on a national scale. Kang explains that “we believe it is more effective to build up community infrastructure to maintain safe communities than it is to rely solely on police.” When analyzing the conversation on community infrastructure, it traditionally is centered on the physical and technical facilities that in desperate need of repair and expansion. When it comes to crime prevention though, this community infrastructure needs to also include the systems at a community level that are connected to the lives and livelihood of the the community immediately affected. These systems form the basis and are sustained through alternative models of harm reduction, as in the case of restoratie and ransformative justice. It is crucial that investment in these system form part of the debate as well. 

When considering contemporary policing models who do they protect? The discrimination and abuse we see playing out reflects the primacy of private property and the people that own it. To efficiently correct this dynamic, neighborhoods must respond with a multifaceted approach that reduces the scope of the police in all our spaces and replaces it with models of justice that honor the lived experiences of the people on the street.
