## BROKEN WINDOWS AT BLUE’S: A QUEER HISTORY OF GENTRIFICATION AND POLICING

This essay by Professor Hanhardt starts with the Blue's Bar police raid in 1982 that once again galvinized LGBT activists to fight against the continued violence experienced by the community. The response is linked to the Stonewall Uprising and is presented as a continuation of the struggle for safety for the queer community in the face of state violence. A new dimension to effort is presented as well, one that sought to change the public's perception of the queer community as being a valuable asset to the city. Together with a PR campaign, there was a concentrated gay investment in traditionally gay neighborhoods which formed a part of a larger middle-class reinvestment in the city. This was effort an effort to address the criticism that the queer community contributed to "social disorder" and the "culture of poverty" that formed the basis of increased patrolling by the cops in public spaces and poor working-class neighborhoods.

The capital flowing into these newly gentrified areas contributed to the expansion of violene against Black and Latinx citizens, enshrined in policies like "stop and frisk". This was especially the case in parts of the city with the most speculative investment. Professor Hanhardt explains how “the celebration of gay investment alongside attacks like the one at Blue’s demonstrates the often bifurcated function of marginalized identity and social non-normativity in postwar urban development policy.” Celebration is largely described through the press as evidenced by the physical juxtaposition of the Blue's Bar to the New York Times headquarters. Newspapers serve the interests of real estate and advocate for the development of neighborhoods that are the most likely to increase their subscription base. This explains why the press suports a policing theory focused on 'social disorder' with origins in the individual.  

As perception of white middle-class gay men as tenants began shifting towards the positive, other members of the queer community, along with citizens involved in street based economies, continued facing discrimination. Gay activism manifested in campaigns that focused on crime control, ignoring in large part the members of the community that did not benefit from white or class priveledge. Leading up to the raid of Blue's Bar, a number of mainstream gay activists were leading community partner policing models and complicit in the liberal vision that framed the War on Poverty. Others, especially those margianilzied within the queer community, organized to challenge this form of gentrification and the perception of safety, instead of true safety, it aimed to create. Through their work, they have created a deeper awareness of how the regulation of non-normative behavior is linked intimately with the real estate machine.
