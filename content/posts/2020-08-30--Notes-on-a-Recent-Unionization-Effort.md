## Background

Recently I sat down with a worker who has successfully unionized their workplace in the tech sector to gather their thoughts on the success and the tactics used in their campaign. They mentioned that it had be a long, multi-year effort that began with informal conversations in the workplace. As is the case with employment at tech companies, organizing workers that are well-paid and have benefitts takes a different form. This is especially the case at their specific workplace given that it is considered one of the more progressive places to work. 

That being the case, the strucutural issues found at most tech companies were present as well as ethical issues involving the software product itself. These were described as design anti-patterns and were wildly unpopular among the workers building the products. There was also the case of toxic management.

The core group behind the unionization effort numbered around a dozen rank and file workers that began discussing the possibility of a union, what they saw as the challenges of broaching the topic to the larger group, and the problematic interpersonal and organizational dimensions of their workplace. They soon came to a set of demands including changes to their terms of service, pay equity and transparency, and including employees on the board. 

The worker in this intial core group mentioned that many challenges presented themselves that seemed insurmountable. One of these was setting up a private means of communication that wasn't traceable by their employer. Another was prepping for the card-check process, a method for employees to organize a labor union in which a majority of employees in a bargaining unit sign authorization forms saying that they want to be represented by a union. This process was done in coordination with an external party. 

## Internal Outreach 

Outreach outside this core group began through a ranking system that listed all non-management workers and their likelihood of supporting the union from 1 - 5.
