The response is linked to the Stonewall Uprising and is presented as a continuation of the struggle for safety for the queer community in the face of state violence. A new dimension to effort is presented as well, one that sought to change the public’s perception of the queer community as being a valuable asset to the city. Together with a PR campaign, there was a concentrated gay investment in traditionally gay neighborhoods which formed a part of a larger middle-class reinvestment in the city. This was effort an effort to address the criticism that the queer community contributed to “social disorder” and the “culture of poverty” that formed the basis of increased patrolling by the cops in public spaces and poor working-class neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>The capital flowing into these newly gentrified areas contributed to the expansion of violene against Black and Latinx citizens, enshrined in policies like “stop and frisk”. This was especially the case in parts of the city with the most speculative investment. Professor Hanhardt explains how “the celebration of gay investment alongside attacks like the one at Blue’s demonstrates the often bifurcated function of marginalized identity and social non-normativity in postwar urban development policy.” Celebration is largely described through the press as evidenced by the physical juxtaposition of the Blue’s Bar to the New York Times headquarters. </p>\n<p>Nespapers serve the interests of real estate and advocate for the development of neighborhoods that are most likely to increase their subscription base. Policing through reifies this relationship </p>\n<h2 id=\"ending-broken-windows-policing-in-new-york-city-an-interview-with-joo-hyun-kang\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#ending-broken-windows-policing-in-new-york-city-an-interview-with-joo-hyun-kang\" aria-label=\"ending broken windows policing in new york city an interview with joo hyun kang permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>ENDING BROKEN WINDOWS POLICING IN NEW YORK CITY: AN INTERVIEW WITH JOO-HYUN KANG</h2>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/policing-the-planet-2","tagSlugs":["/tag/queer-history/","/tag/state-violence/","/tag/gentrification/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-07-04","description":"","tags":["Queer History","State Violence","Gentrification"],"title":"Notes on Policing the Planet - Part 2","socialImage":"/media/pedagogy.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/policing-the-planet-2"}}}
