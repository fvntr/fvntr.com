Dehumanization requires uncompleted beings conscious of their incompleteness. Humanization is the process of overcoming that alienation. A liberatory pedagogy requires oppressed people to recognize the causes of their dehumanization. </p>\n<p>It also presents a paradox. Oppressed people exist without the freedom to exist authentically while also inhabiting fear of what freedom entails. This is a space free of the oppressor within. The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed is to facilitate concrete action against oppression through critical awareness of oppression. It is the means of travelling from oppressed Object to liberated Subject.</p>\n<p>There are two stages of the pedagogy of the oppressed. The first is a commitment to transformation from oppressed Object to liberated Subject. The second stage is the ongoing process of social liberation and creations of a society where permanent liberation becomes an activity of all.  Freire liberations defines as a mode of action (<em>praxis</em>) and reflection (<em>theory</em>) of humans in order to transform social order.</p>\n<p>So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? Because everyone deserves not only to be free to exist, they deserve to be more fully human.  </p>\n<p><strong>The contradiction between the oppressors and the oppressed, and how it is overcome</strong></p>\n<p>The duality of the oppressed is one shaped by and existing in oppression and violence. When the oppressed react to the violence and dehumananization imposed by the oppressors, the oppressing class interprets this as violent. As the oppressors dehumanize others and violate their rights, they themselves also become dehumanized. Only the oppressed, through rebellion, can take away the oppressorâ€™s ability to dominate and suppress. This is an act of love that culminates in the dissolution of the oppressed/oppressor dynamic and leads to humans in the process of liberation. </p>\n<p><strong>Oppression and the oppressors</strong> </p>\n<p><strong>Oppression and the oppressed</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Liberation: not a gift, not a self-achievement, but a mutual process</strong></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-chap-1","tagSlugs":["/tag/critical-pedagogy/","/tag/liberation-theory/","/tag/philosophy-of-education/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-24","description":"So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed?
