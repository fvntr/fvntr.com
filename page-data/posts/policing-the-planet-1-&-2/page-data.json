He laments his suicide shortly after he was released and frames it as the result of the state’s treatment of Black and Brown people as disposable specifically as enshrined through the city’s ‘broken window’s policy’. </p>\n<p>As riots and uprising spread in the 60s, police departments began implementitng the same military and surveillance tactics that were developed against guerrilas in Vietnam. They also regarded Black militants, and by extension Black people, as enemy combatants. The essay cites a 1968 report by the Maryland Crime Commission that details the “commodity riots” that are aimed at instigating political violence and recommends investment in military force to quell domestic unrest. The specific term “broken windows” was first discussed in 1982 by George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson and argued that small infractions led to more serious crimes and that culture differences were the sources of poverty and inequality. They argued that an approach that policed the most minor of infractions aggressively was seen as a way of correcting the cultural deficiencies of the poor. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/policing-the-planet-1-&-2","tagSlugs":["/tag/prison-abolition/","/tag/state-violence/","/tag/neoliberalism/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-28","description":"Notes on Policing the Planet","tags":["Prison Abolition","State Violence","Neoliberalism"],"title":"Notes on Policing the Planet - Why the Policing Crisis Led to Black Lives Matter - Part 1","socialImage":"/media/pedagogy.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/policing-the-planet-1-&-2"}}}
