Dehumanization requires uncompleted beings conscious of their incompleteness. Humanization is the process of overcoming that alienation. A liberatory pedagogy requires oppressed people to recognize the causes of their dehumanization. </p>\n<p>It also presents a paradox. Oppressed people exist without the freedom to exist authentically while also inhabiting fear of what freedom entails. This is a space free of the oppressor within. The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed is to facilitate concrete action against oppression through critical awareness of oppression. Critical awareness here is the knowledge and understanding of social structutes and the dynamics between them and individuals. It leads the individual from oppressed Object to liberated Subject.</p>\n<p>There are two stages of the pedagogy of the oppressed. The first is a commitment to transformation from oppressed Object to liberated Subject. The second stage is the ongoing process of social liberation and creation of a society where permanent liberation becomes an activity of all. Liberation describes the modes of action and reflection that humans employ to transform social order.</p>\n<p>So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? Because everyone deserves to be free and engaged in the process of exploring their own humanity. This cannot be done for anyone. It is dialogical process done with others.</p>\n<p><strong>The contradiction between the oppressors and the oppressed, and how it is overcome</strong></p>\n<p>The duality of the oppressed is one shaped by and existing in oppression and violence. When the oppressed person reacts to the violence and dehumananization imposed by their oppressors, the oppressing class interprets this an attack on their person. It dislocates the oppressor from the priveleges afforded by the labor and value extracted from the oppressed class. Only the oppressed can take away the oppressor’s ability to dominate and suppress. This is an act that Freire describes as love but I would descibe more as fierce compassion. Its culmination is the dissolution of the oppressed/oppressor dynamic and leads humans to the process of liberation. </p>\n<p><strong>Oppression and the oppressors</strong> </p>\n<p>Oppressor conciousness is one that transforms its surroundings into objects of its domination. This leads to a material concept of existence. To possess becomes analogous to existing as a Subject. When confronted with the need to extend this condition to the dispossessed, their ability to possess is justified as an inalienable right acquired through effort and risk-taking. Humanization of the oppressed would result in the loss of their freedom to exploit and this explains the constant need on the oppressor’s part to control and objectify the oppressed. There are those in the oppressor class that are aware of this unjust order, their positionality, and the need for change. However, often times they see themselves as the executors of the transformation which further alienates and objectifies the oppressed. This should not be confused with liberation. </p>\n<p><strong>Oppression and the oppressed</strong></p>\n<p>Oppressed conciousness is characterized by three characteristics. The first is that they are unable to perceive clearly the order that served the interests of the oppressors. This serves to divide the oppressed class and foment violence among each other. Each oppressed person that has an oppressor within themselves. The violence directed towards their own comrades is an indirect attack towards the oppressor.  Second, there is an attraction towards the oppressor and their way of life. Contempt and attraction exist side-by-side and this creates an emotional dependency on the oppressor. This dependency leads a corresponding destruction of life, a behavior that mimics oppressor conciousness. Third, there is self-depreciation and an inferiority complex. </p>\n<p><strong>Liberation: not a gift, not a self-achievement, but a mutual process</strong></p>\n<p>Liberation is a process grounded in critical and librating dialogue. Anything else that is presented as a liberating process but is devoid of reflective participation with the oppressed is just domestication and a continuation of the objectification that governs the oppressed/oppressor dichotomy. Freire writes “Political action on the side of the oppressed must be pedagogical action…with the oppressed.” This leads to a conviction fo the necessity for struggle as Subjects engaged in that struggle. It begins with the recognition that as oppressed people their own agency has been destroyed. It also involves co-intentional education where the leadership of the struggle and its participants re-create the knowledge of reality through common reflection and action and discover themselves as permanent re-creators of that reality. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed-1","tagSlugs":["/tag/critical-pedagogy/","/tag/liberation-theory/","/tag/philosophy-of-education/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-24","description":"So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed?
