He laments his suicide shortly after he was released and frames it as the result of the state’s treatment of Black and Brown people as disposable specifically as enshrined through the city’s ‘broken window’s policy’. </p>\n<p>As riots and uprising spread in the 60s, police departments began implementitng the same military and surveillance tactics that were developed against guerrilas in Vietnam. They also regarded Black militants, and by extension Black people, as enemy combatants. The essay cites a 1968 report by the Maryland Crime Commission that details the “commodity riots” that are aimed at instigating political violence and recommends investment in military force to quell domestic unrest. The specific term “broken windows” was first discussed in 1982 by George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson and argued that small infractions led to more serious crimes and that cultural differences were the sources of poverty and inequality. They argued that an approach that policed the most minor of infractions aggressively was seen as a way of correcting the ‘cultural deficiencies of the poor’. </p>\n<p>Of note is the attention placed to the hardware used by the police in their campaign against Black people as negatively influencing public opinion, not the treatment itself. Parallels are drawn with security forces in Israel and the favela cleansing in Brazil. ‘Broken windows’ is framed as part of a ” global, neoliberal racial regime firmly rooted in the history of settler colonialism”. This is a permanent war that stretches further than any theory of policing or even police departments. The militarized culture in police departments, rooted in settler colonialism, sees all non-White civilians as enemy combatants and advances an array of collective punishment in day-to-day life. Punishment exists outside of the court law. It functions largely in the court of public opinion. </p>\n<p>Kelley focuses now on the linguistic purpose of terms like ‘thug’ and ‘hoodlum’ and the not so apparent systems that support crimizalization of the poor. There is the aforementioned purpose of framing public opion by criminalizing and dehumanizing Black people. This ‘closes off empathy’ for those that may have broken the law in the court of public opinion. The other function is that it masks the violence by the state. If Black people are framed as society’s true source of violence,then the daily violence perpetrated by the state and capital remains hidden.  Racial taxes, in the form of summons and warrants, provide the financial support to keep these systems funded. He describes a <em>racial tax</em> as “a direct extraction of surplus by the state that produces nothing but discipline and terror and the reproduction of the state—in other words, revenue by <em>primitive accumulation</em>.” Primitive accumulation is the process in which the ruling class takes possession of wealth and maintains the poor without land or resources to call their own. They are then stuck at the whims of rent-seeking forces that extract the lab</p>\n<h2 id=\"blacklivesmatter-and-global-visions-of-abolition-an-interview-with-patrisse-cullors\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#blacklivesmatter-and-global-visions-of-abolition-an-interview-with-patrisse-cullors\" aria-label=\"blacklivesmatter and global visions of abolition an interview with patrisse cullors permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>#BLACKLIVESMATTER AND GLOBAL VISIONS OF ABOLITION: AN INTERVIEW WITH PATRISSE CULLORS**</h2>\n<p>In this interview Patrisse points out that the majority of proposals presented today in anti-police brutality work actually serves to make the state more present in our lives. The state should not be a part of the process. What do proposals without state intervention look like? Community-centered alternatives to public safety are needed. A larger conversation about why police are needed is also crucial.  An interesting obeservation is examining people’s fear about not having police. Patrisses points out that “People say, “What are we going do with criminals?” by which they mean “What are we going to do with Black people?”</p>\n<p>The conversation then turn to the global implications anti-Black racism and the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Toronto’s #BlackLivesMatter chapter is provided as an example, specifically the fact that they are aware of the state violence and its victims in the US while the US chapters have little knowledge of the dimension of anti-Black violence outside of the US. In the face of this US-centricity, Patrisse says it is “essential that we center this conversation and also our practice in an international frame.” Our fight is for Black people everywhere. It is also important to build deep bonds with Indigenous people since the Black diaspora, in its displacement, is occupying other people’s land. </p>\n<p>The interview ends with a brief defintion of an abolitionist society as one “rooted in providing for and supporting the self-determination of communities” instead of capital. </p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/policing-the-planet","tagSlugs":["/tag/prison-abolition/","/tag/state-violence/","/tag/neoliberalism/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-28","description":"Notes on Policing the Planet-Why the Policing Crisis Led to Black Lives Matter","tags":["Prison Abolition","State Violence","Neoliberalism"],"title":"Notes on Policing the Planet - Why the Policing Crisis Led to Black Lives Matter - Part 1","socialImage":"/media/pedagogy.png"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/policing-the-planet"}}}
