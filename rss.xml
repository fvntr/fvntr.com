&lt;p&gt;This essay by Professor Hanhardt starts with the Blue’s Bar police raid in 1982 that galvinized LGBT activists to fight against a surging  wave of gentrification. The response is linked to the Stonewall Uprising and is presented as a continuation of the Queer community’s struggle for safety in the face of state violence. A new dimension to this ongoing effort is presented as well, one that sought to change the public’s perception of white, middle class homosexuality as being a valuable asset to the city’s real estate development. Together with PR campaigns, there was concentrated investment in traditionally gay neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital flowing into these newly gentrified areas contributed to the expansion of violence against Black and Latinx communities, enshrined in policies like “stop and frisk”. This was especially the case in parts of the city with the most speculative investment activity. Professor Hanhardt explains how “the celebration of gay investment alongside attacks like the one at Blue’s demonstrates the often bifurcated function of marginalized identity and social non-normativity in postwar urban development policy.” Celebration in this case largely occurred through the press. Newspapers, as an extension of state power, served the interests of the real estate industry and advocated for the development of neighborhoods that were the most likely to increase their subscription base. The fourth estate’s support for a policing theory focused on an individualized origin for ‘social disorder’ was good for business.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aided by the press, attitudes towards white gay homosexuality started shifting. However, other members of the Queer community continued facing discrimination. In the late 70s, mainstream gay activism focused on crime control within communities, ignoring in large part the members of the community that did not benefit from white or class priveledge. Leading up to the raid of Blue’s Bar, a number of mainstream gay activists supported community partner policing models. In doing so, they became complicit in the liberal vision that framed the War on Poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others, especially those margianilzied within the Queer community, organized to challenge this form of gentrification and the perception of safety, instead of true enactment of safety, it aimed to create. Through their work, they have created a deeper awareness of how the regulation of non-heternonormative behavior is linked intimately with the real estate machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interview with Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform (CPR), a campaign to end discriminatory policing practices in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key point that stood out was how community problems need to be taken up by the whole community, particularly the parts of the community that are most impacted by the issues. As policing in urban areas has evolved, it increasingly encompaases more social work outside the realm of traditional police work. This explains the disastrous outcomes that we are seeing on a national scale. Kang explains that “we believe it is more effective to build up community infrastructure to maintain safe communities than it is to rely solely on police.” When analyzing the conversation on community infrastructure, it traditionally is centered on the physical and technical facilities that in desperate need of repair and expansion. When it comes to crime prevention though, this community infrastructure needs to also include the systems at a community level that are connected to the lives and livelihood of the the community immediately affected. These systems form the basis and are sustained through alternative models of harm reduction, as in the case of restoratie and ransformative justice. It is crucial that investment in these system form part of the debate as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When considering contemporary policing models who do they protect? The discrimination and abuse we see playing out reflects the primacy of private property and the people that own it. To efficiently correct this dynamic, neighborhoods must respond with a multifaceted approach that reduces the scope of the police in all our spaces and replaces it with models of justice that honor the lived experiences of the people on the street.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Approaches to Dismantling the Global Surveillance Infrastructure]]></title><description><![CDATA[If surveillance technology has been proven to be biased and racist, what are some approaches to dismantling the global surveillance apparatus that supports its creation?]]></description><link>https://fvntr.github.io/fvntr.com//posts/dismantling-surveillance-infra</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://fvntr.github.io/fvntr.com//posts/dismantling-surveillance-infra</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 id=&quot;draft-approaches-to-dismantling-the-global-surveillance&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#draft-approaches-to-dismantling-the-global-surveillance&quot; aria-label=&quot;draft approaches to dismantling the global surveillance permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[Draft] Approaches to Dismantling the Global Surveillance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following exploration takes as a point of departure the position that the surveillance and crime prevention software supplied to police departments across this country serve to reinforce systemic racism and oppression. For an in-depth analysis of how algorithms reflect the biases of the people that create them, check out Professor Safiya Noble’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_of_Oppression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algorithms of Oppression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explore the latter part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bigblackjacobin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Edward Ongweso Jr’s&lt;/a&gt; recent article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8898g3/police-and-big-tech-are-partners-in-crime-we-need-to-abolish-them-both&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Police and Big Tech Are Partners in Crime.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;austerity for surveillance and social control instead of public institutions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increasing the public ownership of data in order to solve social problems &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public conversation about the tech that certain sectors are allowed to use and not use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;democratizing the production of tech to enable a shift from capital accumulation to social good&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Kelley begins this essay with the story of Khalief Browder, who was held at Rikers for several years due to his inability to pay for bail after he was accused of stealing the backpack. He laments his suicide shortly after he was released and frames it as the result of the state’s treatment of Black and Brown people as disposable specifically as enshrined through the city’s ‘broken window’s policy’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As riots and uprising spread in the 60s, police departments began implementitng the same military and surveillance tactics that were developed against guerrilas in Vietnam. They also regarded Black militants, and by extension Black people, as enemy combatants. The essay cites a 1968 report by the Maryland Crime Commission that details the “commodity riots” that are aimed at instigating political violence and recommends investment in military force to quell domestic unrest. The specific term “broken windows” was first discussed in 1982 by George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson and argued that small infractions led to more serious crimes and that cultural differences were the sources of poverty and inequality. They argued that an approach that policed the most minor of infractions aggressively was seen as a way of correcting the ‘cultural deficiencies of the poor’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note is the attention placed to the hardware used by the police in their campaign against Black people as negatively influencing public opinion, not the treatment itself. Parallels are drawn with security forces in Israel and the favela cleansing in Brazil. ‘Broken windows’ is framed as part of a ” global, neoliberal racial regime firmly rooted in the history of settler colonialism”. This is a permanent war that stretches further than any theory of policing or even police departments. The militarized culture in police departments, rooted in settler colonialism, sees all non-white civilians as enemy combatants and advances an array of collective punishment in day-to-day life. Punishment exists outside of the court law. It functions largely in the court of public opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelley focuses now on the linguistic purpose of terms like ‘thug’ and ‘hoodlum’ and the not so apparent systems that support crimizalization of the poor. There is the previously purpose of framing public opion by criminalizing and dehumanizing Black people. This ‘closes off empathy’ for those that may have broken the law in the court of public opinion. The other function is that it masks the violence by the state. If Black people are framed as society’s true source of violence,then the daily violence perpetrated by the state and capital remains hidden.  Racial taxes, in the form of summons and warrants, provide the financial support to keep these systems funded. He describes a &lt;em&gt;racial tax&lt;/em&gt; as “a direct extraction of surplus by the state that produces nothing but discipline and terror and the reproduction of the state—in other words, revenue by &lt;em&gt;primitive accumulation&lt;/em&gt;.” Primitive accumulation is the process in which the ruling class takes possession of wealth and maintains the poor without land or resources to call their own. They are then stuck at the whims of rent-seeking forces that extract their wages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this interview Patrisse points out that the majority of proposals presented today in anti-police brutality work actually serves to make the state more present in our lives. The state should not be a part of the process. What do proposals without state intervention look like? Community-centered alternatives to public safety are needed. A larger conversation about why police are needed is also crucial.  An interesting obeservation is examining people’s fear about not having police. Patrisse points out that “People say, “What are we going do with criminals?” by which they mean “What are we going to do with Black people?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then turns to the global implications anti-Black racism and the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Toronto’s #BlackLivesMatter chapter is provided as an example, specifically the fact that they are aware of the state violence and its victims in the US while the US chapters have little knowledge of the dimensions of anti-Black violence outside of the US. In the face of this US-centricity, Patrisse says it is “essential that we center this conversation and also our practice in an international frame.” Our fight is for Black people everywhere. It is also important to build deep bonds with Indigenous people since the Black diaspora, in its displacement, is occupying other people’s land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview ends with a brief defintion of an abolitionist society as one “rooted in providing for and supporting the self-determination of communities” instead of capital. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Notes on Pedagogy of the Oppressed - Part 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freire frames oppression as a limiting situation that only the oppressed themselves can transform. Dehumanization requires uncompleted beings conscious of their incompleteness. Humanization is the process of overcoming that alienation. A liberatory pedagogy requires oppressed people to recognize the causes of their dehumanization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also presents a paradox. Oppressed people exist without the freedom to exist authentically while also inhabiting fear of what freedom entails. This is a space free of the oppressor within. The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed is to facilitate concrete action against oppression through critical awareness of oppression. Critical awareness here is the knowledge and understanding of social structutes and the dynamics between them and individuals. It leads the individual from oppressed Object to liberated Subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two stages of the pedagogy of the oppressed. The first is a commitment to transformation from oppressed Object to liberated Subject. The second stage is the ongoing process of social liberation and creation of a society where permanent liberation becomes an activity of all. Liberation describes the modes of action and reflection that humans employ to transform social order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? Because everyone deserves to be free and engaged in the process of exploring their own humanity. This cannot be done for anyone. It is dialogical process done with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The contradiction between the oppressors and the oppressed, and how it is overcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duality of the oppressed is one shaped by and existing in oppression and violence. When the oppressed person reacts to the violence and dehumananization imposed by their oppressors, the oppressing class interprets this an attack on their person. It dislocates the oppressor from the priveleges afforded by the labor and value extracted from the oppressed class which has otherwise been normalized. Normalizing that reality dehumanizes the oppressor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the oppressed can take away the oppressor’s ability to dominate and suppress. This is an act that Freire describes as love but I would descibe more as fierce compassion. Its culmination is the dissolution of the oppressed/oppressor dynamic and leads humans to the process of liberation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oppression and the oppressors&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself thinking about property rights recently. The uprising occurring nationwide has left storefronts destroyed and the toppling of statues is picking up. The media has, as always, been quick to demonize what is going on and has pointed to antifa, black blocs, and white anarchists as the culprits. Putting aside how that framing manipulates of the struggles of oppressed people,I found myseld looking for a historical reference to property rights as they relate to damage during civil unrest. I found an essay by Lucy Parsons written in 1905 called ‘Property Rights vs Human Rights’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She provides an analysis of why property rights supersede human rights and how the institutions that uphold it create unnecessary work to support it. The distinction between unnecessary/useless work and useful labor is one that has special relevance today with the societal shifts going on with COVID-19. The terms ‘essential worker’ has become more and more common during this time as a way of describing the workers and the respective industries necessary to keep society running. This shifts have also highlighted how little power these workers have in their workplace and the precarious conditions endured on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also interesting that within this discourse the other part of the workforce is not mentioned.  If ‘essential workers’ perform necessary work, what does the rest of the labor force do and what are they called? By omission, they inhabit the space of ‘unessential work’ and the nature of this work is what Lucy Parsons highlighted brilliantly. The ‘unessential workers’ here are the class of workers whose main responsibility is to maintain property rights and the systems that support it. This class of worker are not needed to sustain civilization. The nature of their labor is to protect, uphold, and also benefit from private property and property rights. The value of useful labor performed by essential workers is also extracted to sustain private property and property rights, yet the class of essential workers has little to no share in it. Their labor and wages are extracted through rent across all facets of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
