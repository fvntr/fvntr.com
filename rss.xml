&lt;p&gt;The following exploration takes as a point of departure the position that the surveillance and crime prevention software supplied to police departments across this country serve to reinforce systemic racism and oppression. For an in-depth analysis of how algorithms reflect the biases of the people that create them, check out Professor Safiya Noble’s book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_of_Oppression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algorithms of Oppression&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to explore the latter part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bigblackjacobin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Edward Ongweso Jr’s&lt;/a&gt; recent article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8898g3/police-and-big-tech-are-partners-in-crime-we-need-to-abolish-them-both&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Police and Big Tech Are Partners in Crime. We Need to Abolish Them Both&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more in depth here. He proposes the following as ways to shift the balance of the data panoption we live in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;austerity for surveillance and social control instead of public institutions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increasing the public ownership of data in order to solve social problems &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public conversation about the tech that certain sectors are allowed to use and not use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;democratizing the production of tech to enable a shift from capital accumulation to social good&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Kelley begins this essay with the story of Khalief Browder, who was held at Rikers for several years due to his inability to pay for bail after he was accused of stealing the backpack. He laments his suicide shortly after he was released and frames it as the result of the state’s treatment of Black and Brown people as disposable specifically as enshrined through the city’s ‘broken window’s policy’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As riots and uprising spread in the 60s, police departments began implementitng the same military and surveillance tactics that were developed against guerrilas in Vietnam. They also regarded Black militants, and by extension Black people, as enemy combatants. The essay cites a 1968 report by the Maryland Crime Commission that details the “commodity riots” that are aimed at instigating political violence and recommends investment in military force to quell domestic unrest. The specific term “broken windows” was first discussed in 1982 by George L. Kelling and James Q. Wilson and argued that small infractions led to more serious crimes and that cultural differences were the sources of poverty and inequality. They argued that an approach that policed the most minor of infractions aggressively was seen as a way of correcting the ‘cultural deficiencies of the poor’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note is the attention placed to the hardware used by the police in their campaign against Black people as negatively influencing public opinion, not the treatment itself. Parallels are drawn with security forces in Israel and the favela cleansing in Brazil. ‘Broken windows’ is framed as part of a ” global, neoliberal racial regime firmly rooted in the history of settler colonialism”. This is a permanent war that stretches further than any theory of policing or even police departments. The militarized culture in police departments, rooted in settler colonialism, sees all non-White civilians as enemy combatants and advances an array of collective punishment in day-to-day life. Punishment exists outside of the court law. It functions largely in the court of public opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelley focuses now on the linguistic purpose of terms like ‘thug’ and ‘hoodlum’ and the not so apparent systems that support crimizalization of the poor. There is the aforementioned purpose of framing public opion by criminalizing and dehumanizing Black people. This ‘closes off empathy’ for those that may have broken the law in the court of public opinion. The other function is that it masks the violence by the state. If Black people are framed as society’s true source of violence,then the daily violence perpetrated by the state and capital remains hidden.  Racial taxes, in the form of summons and warrants, provide the financial support to keep these systems funded. He describes a &lt;em&gt;racial tax&lt;/em&gt; as “a direct extraction of surplus by the state that produces nothing but discipline and terror and the reproduction of the state—in other words, revenue by &lt;em&gt;primitive accumulation&lt;/em&gt;.” Primitive accumulation is the process in which the ruling class takes possession of wealth and maintains the poor without land or resources to call their own. They are then stuck at the whims of rent-seeking forces that extract the lab&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this interview Patrisse points out that the majority of proposals presented today in anti-police brutality work actually serves to make the state more present in our lives. The state should not be a part of the process. What do proposals without state intervention look like? Community-centered alternatives to public safety are needed. A larger conversation about why police are needed is also crucial.  An interesting obeservation is examining people’s fear about not having police. Patrisses points out that “People say, “What are we going do with criminals?” by which they mean “What are we going to do with Black people?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then turn to the global implications anti-Black racism and the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Toronto’s #BlackLivesMatter chapter is provided as an example, specifically the fact that they are aware of the state violence and its victims in the US while the US chapters have little knowledge of the dimension of anti-Black violence outside of the US. In the face of this US-centricity, Patrisse says it is “essential that we center this conversation and also our practice in an international frame.” Our fight is for Black people everywhere. It is also important to build deep bonds with Indigenous people since the Black diaspora, in its displacement, is occupying other people’s land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview ends with a brief defintion of an abolitionist society as one “rooted in providing for and supporting the self-determination of communities” instead of capital. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Notes on Pedagogy of the Oppressed - Part 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freire frames oppression as a limiting situation that only the oppressed themselves can transform. Dehumanization requires uncompleted beings conscious of their incompleteness. Humanization is the process of overcoming that alienation. A liberatory pedagogy requires oppressed people to recognize the causes of their dehumanization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also presents a paradox. Oppressed people exist without the freedom to exist authentically while also inhabiting fear of what freedom entails. This is a space free of the oppressor within. The justification for a pedagogy of the oppressed is to facilitate concrete action against oppression through critical awareness of oppression. It is the means of travelling from oppressed Object to liberated Subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two stages of the pedagogy of the oppressed. The first is a commitment to transformation from oppressed Object to liberated Subject. The second stage is the ongoing process of social liberation and creations of a society where permanent liberation becomes an activity of all.  Freire liberations defines as a mode of action (&lt;em&gt;praxis&lt;/em&gt;) and reflection (&lt;em&gt;theory&lt;/em&gt;) of humans in order to transform social order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why do we need a pedagogy of the oppressed? Because everyone deserves to be free to exist &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; be more fully human.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The contradiction between the oppressors and the oppressed, and how it is overcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duality of the oppressed is one shaped by and existing in oppression and violence. When the oppressed react to the violence and dehumananization imposed by the oppressors, the oppressing class interprets this as violent. As the oppressors dehumanize others and violate their rights, they themselves also become dehumanized. Only the oppressed, through rebellion, can take away the oppressor’s ability to dominate and suppress. This is an act of love that culminates in the dissolution of the oppressed/oppressor dynamic and leads to humans in the process of liberation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oppression and the oppressors&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oppression and the oppressed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found myself thinking about property rights recently. The uprising occurring nationwide has left storefronts destroyed and the toppling of statues is picking up. The media has, as always, been quick to demonize what is going on and has pointed to antifa, black blocs, and white anarchists as the culprits. Putting aside how that framing manipulates of the struggles of oppressed people,I found myseld looking for a historical reference to property rights as they relate to damage during civil unrest. I found an essay by Lucy Parsons written in 1905 called ‘Property Rights vs Human Rights’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She provides an analysis of why property rights supersede human rights and how the institutions that uphold it create unnecessary work to support it. The distinction between unnecessary/useless work and useful labor is one that has special relevance today with the societal shifts going on with COVID-19. The terms ‘essential worker’ has become more and more common during this time as a way of describing the workers and the respective industries necessary to keep society running. This shifts have also highlighted how little power these workers have in their workplace and the precarious conditions endured on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;figure style=&quot;width: 240px&quot;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Lucy Parsons&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also interesting that within this discourse the other part of the workforce is not mentioned.  If ‘essential workers’ perform necessary work, what does the rest of the labor force do and what are they called? By omission, they inhabit the space of ‘unessential work’ and the nature of this work is what Lucy Parsons highlighted brilliantly. The ‘unessential workers’ here are the class of workers whose main responsibility is to maintain property rights and the systems that support it. This class of worker are not needed to sustain civilization. The nature of their labor is to protect, uphold, and also benefit from private property and property rights. The value of useful labor performed by essential workers is also extracted to sustain private property and property rights, yet the class of essential workers has little to no share in it. Their labor and wages are extracted through rent across all facets of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
